## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript form validation


### What I learned

This project teached me how to implement a JavaScript form validation and style a sign up form with CSS.

The layout is controlled with CSS grid. The grid uses template areas to arrange the content. For mobile layout, the arrangement of the grid areas is changed to produce a row layout.

The SVG Icon for the validation error is used as background image of a pseudo element in the input div.
